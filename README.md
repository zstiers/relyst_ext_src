# relyst_ext_src

The code under the ext folder is not mine. It is the source for libraries being used by [relyst](https://github.com/zstiers/relyst). I wanted it out of the main directory to avoid bloating the depot with the source code for prebuilt binaries. Said source copies exist so that if I need to rebuild the binaries for any reason, such as a new compiler, I have the same version I've been using all along.
